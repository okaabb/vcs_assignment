1. Create a git repository contains a C++ code that has a function getSum takes a vector as a parameter and returns the summation of the elements inside the vector.
2. Insidethemainfunctioncreateavectorcontains10integersandprintthe output of getSum function.
3. Publish this repository to GitHub.
4. Then create 2 branches and add to them the following:
First Branch:
Add another function getAverage that takes a vector as an argument and returns the average of this vector. And print the output of this function in the main function after printing getSum function.
Second Branch:
Add another function getMin that takes a vector as an argument and returns the minimum element in the vector. And print the output of this function in the main function after printing getSum function.
5. Mergefirstbranchtothemainbranch.
6. Merge second branch to the main branch. (Resolve conflicts if needed)
